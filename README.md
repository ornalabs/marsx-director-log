# MarsX Navigation Concepts

This repo us just a place to test out some non-vr concepts for a WebXR game called MarsX.

Ideas

- Navigate multiple levels outside of VR.
  - Bacause linking while in VR is not a solved problem, we are exploring some ideas to make level progression as simple as possible
- Store data related to game play and level progress
  - Use local storage?
  - User accounts?

## General notes

- Vite / Vue JS project with Router
- A-Frame for the WebXR scenes
- CSS boilerplate provided by Pico CSS. Hardcoded into the `index.html` https://picocss.com/
- Basic (and hacky) split view with navigation on the side
